Before optimizing the objective function let's compare its values at the following points:

f(0.2500, 1.0000, 1.0000, 0.0100) = 
f(0.3015, 1.2460, 1.1922, 0.0484) = 
f(0.2200, 1.1200, 1.3700, 0.0500) = 
f(0.2066, 0.8372, 0.6654, 0.0077) = 
f(0.2462, 1.2772, 1.1675, 0.0420) = 
f(0.1373, 1.0525, 1.4881, 0.0479) = 

We can see that (0.2500, 1.0000, 1.0000, 0.0100) is not a minimum of function f.
