True generator parameters are represented by the following point: \
theta_g1 = 0.25 \
theta_g2 = 1.00 \
theta_g3 = 1.00 \
theta_g4 = 0.01

To study the objective function in proximity to this point we have prepared some plots.
All these plots are based on data from *Sim_Data* and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) = 45.

For example, vary_theta_g1.pdf plot fixes all generator parameters except for the first one.
The first parameter is varied and values of the objective function are calculated.
Other plots should be interpreted in a similar way.
