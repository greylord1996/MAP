True generator parameters are represented by the following point: \
theta_g1 = 0.25 \
theta_g2 = 1.00 \
theta_g3 = 1.00 \
theta_g4 = 0.01 \
(it is worth noticing that the minimum of our objective function can be at another point).

To study the objective function in proximity to this point we have prepared some plots.
For example, vary_theta_g1.pdf plot fixes all generator parameters except for the first one.
The first parameter is varied and values of the objective function is calculated.
Other plots should be interpreted in a similar way.
