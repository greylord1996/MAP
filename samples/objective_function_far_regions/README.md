True generator parameters are represented by the following point: \
theta_g1 = 0.25 \
theta_g2 = 1.00 \
theta_g3 = 1.00 \
theta_g4 = 0.01

To study the objective function in proximity to this point we have prepared some plots.
All these plots are based on data from *Sim_Data*.

For example, *vary_theta_g1_SNR=20.pdf* and *vary_theta_g1_SNR=45.pdf* plots fix all generator parameters except for the first one.
The first parameter is varied (for various SNR) and values of the objective function are calculated.
Other plots should be interpreted in a similar way.
